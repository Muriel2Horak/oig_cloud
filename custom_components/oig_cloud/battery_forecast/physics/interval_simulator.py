"""Interval Simulator - core physics for battery simulation.

This module provides a stateless simulator for single interval calculations.
All CBB modes are implemented according to CBB_MODES_DEFINITIVE.md:

HOME I (mode=0):
    - During day: Solar → Load → Battery, deficit from Battery
    - At night: Battery discharges to cover load (same as II, III)
    - Export: Only when battery is 100% full

HOME II (mode=1):
    - During day: Solar → Load → Battery, deficit from GRID (battery untouched)
    - At night: Battery discharges (same as I, III)
    - Export: Only when battery is 100% full

HOME III (mode=2):
    - During day: ALL solar → Battery, load from GRID
    - At night: Battery discharges (same as I, II)
    - Export: Only when battery is 100% full

HOME UPS (mode=3):
    - Solar → Battery (DC/DC)
    - Load from GRID
    - Grid → Battery (AC/DC) charging enabled
    - Export: Only when battery is 100% full
