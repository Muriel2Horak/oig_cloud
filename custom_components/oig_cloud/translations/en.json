Calculates how much energy you need to heat the water\n2. Finds the cheapest time slots before deadline (e.g., 20:00)\n3. Creates a plan of when to turn on the boiler\n4. Controls a switch for turning heating on/off\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Note:** This module only controls WHEN to heat. Physical switching of the boiler must be handled by automation or smart switch.",
